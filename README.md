Using electron JS minimal browser to access WordPress dashboard.
The recent WP Desktop app might be good, but the calypso layout is not as userfriendlyand misses plugin options like SEO which are very important. Also wordpress being open source should not force us to download, install and give access to propritery jetpack plugin to use the app.

Thus 

The idea creating this app was, 
When people be on web instead of doing work, they get involved in a lot of things.
Thus web being a distraction when opened through a browser;
This app would allow users to

* To open wordpress dashboard straight using the login link making them focused to job.
* Would allow all functionality they have on original dashboard and their website visible inside the app.
* Creating a desktop Icon promoting and motivating a user when the computer starts to open app rather than browser.
*  Instead of using the calpyso layout give option for users to use the old wordpress dashboard layout.
