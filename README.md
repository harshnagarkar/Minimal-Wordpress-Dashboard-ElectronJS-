# Minimal-Wordpress-Dashboard-ElectronJS-
Using electron JS minimal browser to access WordPress dashboard.

The idea creating this app was, 
When people be on web instead of doing work, they get involved in a lot of things.
Thus web being a distraction when opened through a browser;
This app would allow users to

* To open wordpress dashboard straight using the login link.
* Would allow all functionality they have on dashboard and their website.
* Create a desktop Icon promoting and motivating a user when the computer starts to open app rather than browser.
* In future show notifications,etc

Feel free to download and clone and improve this mini project.
